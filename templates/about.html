        GRIET Events is an innovative web-based platform designed to streamline and simplify event management within GRIET.
        Built using Flask and MongoDB, this platform allows students and organizers to register, log in securely, and manage events with ease.
        With a stylish, glassmorphic UI and responsive design, users can submit essential event details like name, type, date, size, sub-events, and eligibility.
        Once logged in, users access a personalized dashboard displaying key event statistics and data-driven insights.
        Whether it's a technical symposium or a cultural fest, GRIET Events centralizes all information under one roof.
        Flash messages provide real-time feedback, ensuring a smooth user experience, while the announcement board keeps everyone updated.
        Designed to be both functional and visually engaging, GRIET Events is not just a portalâ€”it's the future of college event coordination.
